The main purpose of the code in this python script is to:

    1) preprocess the raw data (high and low pass filter, exclude bad channels, interpolate bad channels)
    2) plot the ICA solutions generated in 'run_ica.py' so noise components can be identified.

Noise components should be added to session_info.py
